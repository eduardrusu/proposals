4. Equinox of position in format YYYY.Y
    2000.0
5. Are photometric conditions necessary? (Yes/No)
    No
6. Observation mode (Imaging/Grism/Echelle) imaging
  i. For imaging, do you need AO188? (Yes/No) Yes
  ii. NGS, or LGS? LGS
7. Magnitude/range of magnitudes in a specified NIR band.
    AB-system K=19.5, H=19.6 mag/arcsec^2 (arc feature)
8. What is the maximum acceptable seeing size (in arcseconds) in the specified NIR band? In case of using AO188, please provide the maximum acceptable FWHM of the point-spread function after the AO correction.
  0.2 arcseconds
9. Please describe the AO guide stars as follows.
  i. R (or, V if not available) magnitude of your AO guide star.
     R=15.0
  ii. Separation between the target and the AO guide star
     46 arcseconds (see the finding chart)
  iii. Whether the AO guide star is a point source or not. 
     point source
10. Filter(s)/Band configuration for observation. If more than one filter is to be used, separate them with commas.
     Kp, H
11. Pixel scale of camera detector array for imaging, or Grism spectroscopy (20MAS/52MAS).
